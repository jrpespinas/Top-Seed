# Organizer Session Dashboard Page

## Route

- `/organizer/sessions/:sessionId/dashboard`

## Primary User

- Organizer.

## User Goal

Run a live badminton session: courts, queue lanes, suggested matches, active matches, organizer-managed player check-ins, and payment exceptions.

This is the primary offline operating page for MVP v1.

The dashboard should behave like a digital pegboard: available players move into next-match staging lanes, then onto visible court slots, then return to `waiting` after results. The organizer must explicitly start play on court. `resting` is manual only. State rules: `docs/specs/backend/state-transitions.md`.

## Entry Points

- Opening an active session from `/organizer/sessions`.
- Redirect after creating a session.

## Data Dependencies

- Session detail.
- Courts.
- Check-ins.
- Queue lanes, queued matches, queue state, and suggestions.
- Active and recent matches.
- Payment summary.
- Local session snapshot.
- Sync outbox state.
- Connection status.

## Component Composition

**Layout shell:** `docs/specs/frontend/features/organizer/live-dashboard-layout.md`

- `SessionWorkspaceBar` — immersive sticky session chrome (global app header hidden on this route)
- `AttentionRail` — conditional exceptions (desktop); replaces `SessionStatusBar` on desktop
- `PegboardLayout` — three-zone grid
  - `PlayerPool`: composes `PlayerCheckInPanel` and `QueuePanel`. See `features/organizer/player-pool.md`.
  - `CourtBoard`
  - `NextQueuePanel`: composes `QueueLaneManagement`. See `features/organizer/next-queue-panel.md`.
- `SupportingStrip` — collected total, recent teaser, links (not full payment/history/leaderboard cards)
- `ActiveMatchPanel`
- `SyncStatusBadge` (in header when synced; no duplicate banner)
- `PlayerDetailDrawer` (overlay)
- `SyncReviewPanel` (overlay)

**Desktop — not top-level on dashboard:** `SessionStatusBar`, full `PaymentSummaryPanel`, full `RecentMatchesPanel`, `LeaderboardPreview`, always-visible `OfflineBanner`. Those live on dedicated routes or inside `SupportingStrip` / `AttentionRail`.

## Responsive Layout

See `features/organizer/live-dashboard-layout.md` for wireframes, empty states, and validation checklist.

Desktop (≥1280px):

- Session chrome + conditional `AttentionRail` + pegboard (~70vh min, no scroll for core ops).
- Left: `PlayerPool` (compact check-in + waiting list).
- Center: `CourtBoard` — **horizontal strip for 3 courts** (not 2×2 with orphan slot).
- Right: `NextQueuePanel`.
- `SupportingStrip` below pegboard (hidden until first check-in) — not full-width payment/history/leaderboard cards.

Tablet:

- Keep `CourtBoard` and `NextQueuePanel` visible together.
- Place `PlayerPool` below or beside them depending on width.
- Do not use the deprecated full-width secondary card stack.

Mobile:

- Co-primary organizer device. Prefer bottom tabs: **Now** (default) | **Next** | **Available** | **More** per `docs/specs/frontend/design-system.md`.
- `SessionStatusBar` acceptable on **More** tab.
- Fallback stack: sync → courts → next queue → check-in → player pool → payments → recent matches.
- Do not require drag-and-drop; provide buttons for assign, swap, move to court, and remove.

## Navigation

Secondary routes are reached from the workspace bar **overflow menu** (`···`), not a pill row:

- Payments → `/organizer/sessions/:sessionId/payments`
- Match history → `/organizer/sessions/:sessionId/history`
- Leaderboard (this session) → `/organizer/leaderboard?sessionId=:sessionId`
- All sessions → `/organizer/sessions`

`/organizer/sessions/:sessionId/players` redirects to the dashboard in MVP v1. Player check-in and queue management live on the dashboard `PlayerPool`.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Organizer can run the session without leaving the dashboard for common actions.
- Player add/check-in is performed by the organizer, not by player self-service.
- Dashboard layout follows `Available`, `Next`, and `Now` pegboard flow.
- Courts and next lined-up matches are visible at the same time on tablet and desktop.
- Organizer can add, rename, reorder, and delete queue lanes from the dashboard.
- Deleting a non-empty queue lane clearly warns that queued matches in that lane will be removed.
- Queue lane deletion never affects matches already assigned to courts.
- Organizer can choose which queued match from which lane goes to which open court.
- Organizer can complete matches as winner/loser, draw, or unscored.
- Cancelling a match is available as a distinct path from unscored completion.
- Rated sessions surface rating impact for wins and draws when available.
- Dashboard remains usable offline from local session state.
- Add player, check-in, court, queue lane, queued match, match, and payment actions save locally first.
- Pending and failed sync states are visible and recoverable.
- Dashboard remains useful when suggestions are unavailable.
- Manual override paths are visible.
- Realtime or polling updates do not erase in-progress form input.
